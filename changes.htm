        Initially we planned on the website to follow a hierarchical organization with 4 pages titled 'Home', 'About Us', 'Portfolios', 'Contact Us'. But upon starting to work on the creating the website and reviewing examples and templates, we came to a decision that a Linear organization with a single flow that takes visitors from one content to another.

        We felt that this flow makes it easier for the visitors to get from one section to another and the webpage loads faster than in a hierarchical organization. We were still able to include the sections we wanted to include and the website better depicts the business.
